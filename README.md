# MoNeT_MGDrivE

This module was created to accompany the [MGDrivE](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) and [MoNeT](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/) projects to make the analysis of the spatiotemporal simulations of gene-drive spreads as seamless as possible.

It is also meant to serve as a platform to ensure the reproducibility of results of the publications from our [research group at UC, Berkeley](https://www.marshalllab.com/), as part of [DARPA's: Safe Genes program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/safe-genes) and [UCI Malaria  Initiative](http://malaria.bio.uci.edu/).


To install the package from the [pypi version](https://pypi.org/project/MoNeT-MGDrivE/), run:

```bash
pip install MoNeT_MGDrivE
```
